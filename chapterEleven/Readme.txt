Chapter Eleven
Messages only started displaying properly when I ran JDK 11 instead of JDK 17. Going back to JDK 17 after running 11 fixed the display as well. But I only get illegalAccess error in 11 whereas I get a lot more in JDK 17. So stick to 11 for now.

In PortfolioHomePage.java, changed es_SP to es_ES because es_SP did not do anything.
